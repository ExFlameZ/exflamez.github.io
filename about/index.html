			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>This is me, ExFlameZ. Some people call me Fireflame. I started out my journey when I lost my pet. After 2 years of waiting, I decided to look for him throughout the universe. Basically it's a story of me trying to find my pet. But...I was affected by some kinda of demonic meteorite and somehow I'm half-demon half-human now... It's scary.
